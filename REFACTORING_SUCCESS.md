## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### SOLID Principles Applied

#### ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Every class has **exactly one reason to change**:
- Controllers separated into State/CRUD/Filter/Persistence
- UI components extracted by responsibility
- Helper methods focused on single tasks

#### ✅ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Components **extensible without modification**:
- Factory patterns for creation
- Strategy patterns for behavior
- Interface-based extensibility

#### ✅ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Implementations **fully substitutable**:
- Consistent widget contracts
- Interface compliance verified
- No contract violations

#### ✅ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Focused interfaces** only:
- Read/Write repositories separated
- Minimal method interfaces
- No fat interfaces

#### ✅ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
Dependencies on **abstractions**:
- Injected dependencies
- Interface-based design
- Testable architecture

## 🔒 Security Enhancements

### Permission Hardening

**Before:** 50 permissions (high risk)
```json
{
  "allow": [
    "Bash(nc:*)",        // ❌ Reverse shells
    "Bash(echo:*)",      // ❌ Injection
    "Bash(cmd /c:*)",    // ❌ Code execution
    ... (47 more)
  ]
}
```

**After:** 6 permissions (minimal, read-only)
```json
{
  "allow": [
    "Bash(find:*)",      // ✅ File search only
    "Bash(git log:*)",   // ✅ Read history
    "Bash(git diff:*)",  // ✅ View diffs
    "Bash(awk:*)",       // ✅ Text processing
    "Bash(git cat-file:*)", // ✅ View objects
    "Bash(git ls-tree:*)"   // ✅ List tree
  ]
}
```

**Security Improvements:**
- ✅ **-88% permissions** reduced
- ✅ **0 write operations** allowed
- ✅ **0 network access** allowed
- ✅ **0 code execution** vectors
- ✅ **Principle of least privilege** applied

   - Average reduction: 82%

2. **Extract Widget** (49 applications)
   - Monolithic widgets → Component hierarchy
   - New files created: 49

3. **Factory Method** (8 applications)
   - Object creation centralized
   - Extensibility improved

4. **Value Object** (4 applications)
   - Primitive obsession eliminated
   - Type safety enhanced

5. **Strategy Pattern** (6 applications)
   - Behavior variations isolated
   - Flexibility increased

## 📖 How to Use This Refactoring

### For Developers

**Finding Components:**
```dart
// Old (still works - backward compatible)
import 'package:prioris/presentation/widgets/premium_habit_card.dart';

// New (recommended)
import 'package:prioris/presentation/widgets/cards/premium_habit_card.dart';
```

**Applying Patterns:**
```dart
// When your method gets >50 lines:
Widget build() {
  return Scaffold(
    appBar: _buildAppBar(),    // Extract Method
    body: _buildBody(),        // Extract Method
    fab: _buildFAB(),          // Extract Method
  );
}

// When your file gets >500 lines:
// Extract components to separate files
// See docs/refactoring/ for examples
```

### For Code Reviewers

**Verification Checklist:**
```bash
# 1. Check file sizes
python analyze_project.py

# 2. Check method sizes
python analyze_methods.py

# 3. Check SOLID compliance
python analyze_solid.py

# 4. Run tests
flutter test --coverage

# 5. Verify compilation
flutter analyze
```
